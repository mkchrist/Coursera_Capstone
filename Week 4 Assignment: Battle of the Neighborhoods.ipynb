They currently run a successful Pizzeria in New Jersey which they will be selling to fund a new restaurant in the Sacramento region. They have hired my consulting firm to provide assistance to help them determine what part of the region would be the ideal spot to open their new restaurant. Optimally, they would like to open their restaurant in a region that is near event venues, corporate centers and recreational activities while also minimizing competition by opening in an area that lacks in current Pizzeria restaurants.
